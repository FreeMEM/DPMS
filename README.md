Demo Party Management System For Sceners

 I'm  computing passionated since 1984. I organized RadyKal Party at Granada, Spain in 1998 and I visit every years another Amiga Parties around Spain. The last years I've collaborated with Posadas Party and Capacitor Party. I began to develop a web application to manage the next Capacitor Amiga Party but the pandemic cancelled the project. Last summer (2022), Posadas Party celebrated a new edition and we needed a tool for the people to vote the competitions. We used wuhu, a well known Party Management System (PMS) written in PHP programing language. I liked its functions and how manages the data to the competitions and its "beamer" system. But its register system it's too simple and insecure. Wuhu it's though more like a intranet application used only for the event day. But I would want something more secure to keep online on internet.
